# Loan-Status-Prediction
Predict loan status by analyzing historical loan data and identifying patterns that can be used to predict future loan outcomes. This can be done using various ML techniques such as decision trees, random forests, logistic regression, and neural networks.predict loan status by analyzing historical loan data and identifying patterns that can be used to predict future loan outcomes. This can be done using various ML techniques such as decision trees, random forests, logistic regression, and neural networks. The data used for training the ML model typically includes information about the borrower, such as credit score, income, and employment history, as well as information about the loan, such as the amount, interest rate, and repayment terms. Once the model is trained, it can be used to predict the likelihood of loan defaults or other outcomes for new loan applications.
